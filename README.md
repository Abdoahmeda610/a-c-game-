## My First C++ Game: Citizen Savior

## Introduction
Welcome to my first game developed using C++! In this game, you will take control of the protagonist (X) and face off against two enemies (tow #). These enemies have stolen the citizens (×) of your world, and it's up to you to rescue them. Your objective is to guide the citizens to safety in a designated area called the "wait house" located at the top of the game.

## Rules
You are allowed to pick up one citizen (×) at a time, and you must pick them up in a specific order. However, be careful as the enemies(# #) will try to attack you along the way. If they catch you, you will be returned to your starting position, and any citizens you were carrying will be left behind.
