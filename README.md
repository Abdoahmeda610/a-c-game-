### My First C++ Game: Citizen Savior

### Introduction
Welcome to my first game developed using C++! In this game, you will take control of the protagonist (X) and face off against two enemies (tow #). These enemies have stolen the citizens (×) of your world, and it's up to you to rescue them. Your objective is to guide the citizens to safety in a designated area called the "wait house" located at the top of the game.

## Rules
You are allowed to pick up one citizen '(×)' at a time, and you must pick them up in a specific order. However, be careful as the enemies(# #) will try to attack you along the way. If they catch you, you will be returned to your starting position, and any citizens you were carrying will be left behind.

## How to Play - Keyboard Controls
- Use ` d ` to move right 👉
- Use ` a ` to move left 👈
- Use ` w ` to move up ☝️
- Use ` s ` to move down 👇

Thank you for playing my first game! Enjoy the challenge of saving the citizens and defeating the enemies.
